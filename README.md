just use this link https://github.com/kushwaha03/iOS_DeviceSupport.git for ios 13 device supported download then unzip 13.0, 13,1, 13,2 and paste in this directory /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport

Quit or exit your xcode then open xcode project and run. still not work then just restart your system then it ll be work.

note : if you got other device error, don't worry just copy any ios 13 folder and paste same directory and rename with error device ios version.

let me know if you have doubt. good luck!
